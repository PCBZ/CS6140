# CS6140 Machine Learning — Homework Repository

This repository contains homework assignments and solutions for the CS6140 Machine Learning course.

## Overview

This repo is dedicated to coursework for CS6140 (Machine Learning). Each assignment is organized as a separate directory, including jupyter notebooks, latex files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PCBZ/CS6140.git
    cd CS6140
    ```

2. **Requirements**

   ### Python/Jupyter Notebooks
   Most code is written in Jupyter notebooks and intended to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides most common data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) pre-installed.

   ### LaTeX
   - Some homework problems and solutions are written in LaTeX (`.tex` files).
   - To compile LaTeX files, you’ll need a TeX distribution such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (cross-platform), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows), or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (macOS).
   - You can compile a `.tex` file to PDF from the command line:
     ```bash
        pdflatex filename.tex
     ```
- Many editors (e.g., VS Code with LaTeX Workshop, TeXShop, Overleaf online) also support LaTeX editing and compilation.

## Structure

- Each homework assignment is in its own file or folder.
- Supporting data files or notebooks may be included as needed.
- Please refer to assignment-specific README or comments for details.
